Star Fox Inspired User Interface created with the Processing Framework

### Instructions to use:
All you will need to use this program is a mouse and use of the spacebar. The mouse is used to move a reticle around on the screen while the spacebar is used to activate the chatter function.

### Description
This program is a User Interface for an Arwing fighter spacecraft from the Starfox series of games. Pressing the spacebar in this program will display an image of one of the pilots from Starfox along with a relevant quote and a voice sample. Moving the mouse around will move a reticle on screen. The intent for this was to aim over little enemy planes on screen and destroy them but there were issues implementing the hit detection for this feature. The only way to destroy the planes is by making the x axis of the reticle be equal to less than 15.
